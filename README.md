### Problem Statement Track - HealthCare

### Problem Statement :
- Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals had to suspend OPD appointement or was restricted because of social distancing norms.
- As the appointments at hospitals were restricted as hospitals were dedicated to COVID patients, and the normal patient suffered (from all sections of society).
- As there isn't any system or solution which proposes or tells which hospital is operating or treating OPD patients.
- There also needs to be contactless appointment system for people (patients) so that they can effectively meet doctors and take prescriptions.

### Solution :
- A QR based portal for appointments for patients, they need to register on our android application, and book appointment with their respective specialists. A booking QR will will generated and scanned by doctor using the same application,and after scanning all the patients data will be prefilled into doctor's system.
- Then Doctor can treat and give prescription for the same to the patients, and pdf report prescription will be available to the patient.
- As doctors install our application, we will be having data of hospitals having OPD operations running.
- This solution emphasis on **Contactless-Paperless System for both doctors and Patients**.
